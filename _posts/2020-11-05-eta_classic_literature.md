title: Exploratory Text Analytics on Classic Literature
---

On March 1, 1999, BBC News published an article with a list of the Top 10 Writers voted by readers. Iâ€™ve compiled a collection of select works by some of the writers in the list and other internationally renowned authors to analyze their similarity and difference:

* American (Mark Twain)
* English (Charles Dickens and Robert Louis Stevenson)
* Russian (Fyodor Dostoevsky)
* Spanish (Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra)
* French (Gaston Leroux)

The analysis aims to look for any linguistic or cultural trend that these works might share in light of explaining why they are considered as the must-read and iconic books of all time.

There seems to be a clear distinction among the writings based on the authors' cultural background. However, these also seem to share a similar linguistic pattern which is what perhaps makes the readers around the world to collectively receive these masterpieces as timeless literature.
